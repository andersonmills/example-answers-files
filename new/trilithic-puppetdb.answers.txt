q_install=y
# Y or N — Whether to install. Answer files must set this to Y.

q_vendor_packages_install=y

q_run_updtvpkg=n
# Y or N — Only used on AIX. Whether to run the updtvpkg command to add info about native libraries to the RPM database. The answer should usually be Y, unless you have special needs around the RPM database.

#--------------------------------------------------------------------
# Roles
# These answers are always needed.

q_puppetmaster_install=n
# Y or N — Whether to install the puppet master role.

q_puppetdb_install=y
# Y or N — Whether to install the database support (the console Postgres server and PuppetDB) role.

q_puppet_enterpriseconsole_install=n
# Y or N — Whether to install the console role.

q_puppet_cloud_install=n

#--------------------------------------------------------------------
# Puppet Agent Answers
# These answers are always needed.

q_puppetagent_certname=pe-puppetdb.localdomain
# String — An identifying string for this agent node. This per-node ID must be unique across your entire site. Fully qualified domain names are often used as agent certnames.

q_puppetagent_server=pe-master.localdomain
# String — The hostname of the puppet master server. For the agent to trust the master’s certificate, this must be one of the valid DNS names you chose when installing the puppet master.

q_fail_on_unsuccessful_master_lookup=y
#Y or N — Whether to quit the install if the puppet master cannot be reached.

### REMARKABLE
q_skip_master_verification=n
#Y or N — This is a silent install option, default is N. When set to Y, the installer will skip master verification which allows the user to deploy agents when they know the master won’t be available.

#--------------------------------------------------------------------
# Puppet Master Answers
# These answers are generally needed if you are installing the puppet master role.

q_all_in_one_install=n
# Y or N — Whether or not the installation is an all-in-one installation, (i.e., are puppetdb and the console also being installed on this node).

q_puppetmaster_certname=pe-master.localdomain
# String — An identifying string for the puppet master. This ID must be unique across your entire site. The server’s fully qualified domain name is often used as the puppet master’s certname.

### REMARKABLE
# q_puppetmaster_dnsaltnames=pe-master,pe-master.localdomain
# String — Valid DNS names at which the puppet master can be reached. Must be a comma-separated list. In a normal installation, defaults to <hostname>,<hostname.domain>,puppet,puppet.<domain>.

### REMARKABLE

# String — The hostname of the server running the console role. Only needed if you are not installing the console role on the puppet master server.

q_puppetmaster_enterpriseconsole_port=443

q_pe_check_for_updates=n
#y or n; MUST BE LOWERCASE — Whether to check for updates whenever the pe-httpd service restarts. To get the correct update info, the server will pass some basic, anonymous info to Puppet Labs’ servers. Specifically, it will transmit:
#the IP address of the client
#the type and version of the client’s OS
#the installed version of PE
#the number of nodes licensed and the number of nodes used
#If you wish to disable update checks (e.g. if your company policy forbids transmitting this information), you will need to set this to n. You can also disable checking after installation by editing the /etc/puppetlabs/installer/answers.install file.

q_disable_live_manangement=n
#Y or N — Whether to disable or enable live management in the console. Note that you need to manually add this question to your answer to file before an installation or upgrade.

q_puppet_enterpriseconsole_auth_database_name=console_auth

# If you wish to disable update checks (e.g. if your company policy forbids transmitting this information), you will need to set this to n. You can also disable checking after installation by editing the /etc/puppetlabs/installer/answers.install file.

# q_public_hostname=
